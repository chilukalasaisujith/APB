# APB Protocol Implementation.

This project involves the design and implementation of an Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) protocol using Verilog, System Verilog, and Questa Sim. The APB protocol is a part of the Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) used for connecting low-bandwidth peripherals to the system bus.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages:** Verilog, System Verilog
- **Simulation Tools:** Questa Sim

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design, implement, and verify an APB protocol. The APB is designed to support low-bandwidth control accesses, which are typically found in peripheral devices such as UART, timer, and interrupt controller. 

## Key Features
- **RTL Design and Simulation:** Utilized Verilog for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design and simulation, ensuring compliance with APB specifications.
- **Bus Arbitration:** Resolved critical issues related to bus arbitration.
- **Optimization:** Optimized the design for efficient data transfer.

## Detailed Description
1. **Design and Implementation:**
   - Led the design and implementation of the APB protocol.
